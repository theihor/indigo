<p>Hi! I am a software engineer from Ukraine. I've started to work in software 
development when I still was a student in KPI, and it's been more than 6 years now.
In 2017 I've got my Master's degree in and now I live and work in Kyiv.</p>

<p>Currently I work with ISS Soft Ukraine on development of compilers and tools for code analysis.
Most of the time I program in Common Lisp, though I am familiar with a number of other
programming languages such as Python, Java, and even a bit of Haskell. I also had to work with
some monsters like COBOL and PL/SQL. Some of my early working experience was in gamedev and localization.

<p>In the unversity I was really into machine learning and heuristic optimization algorithms (such as 
genetic algorithms, ABC, PSO, NEAT). But unfortunately I didn't have a chance to apply this knowledge 
and skills in professional environment (yet).</p>

<p>As a typical programmer I of course have many ideas for projects I never spend enough time on :( 
I have some CL code about reinforcement learning, a not completely embarassing attempt to implement 
a table game in Python, a code from ICFP contests that I regularly take part in with my colleagues, 
and some other stuff that you may find on my github if you have nothig better to do.</p>

<p>If you happen to be interested in my professional skills and experience here is my one-page resume
and here is my detailed CV. You can reach me by an email: {{ site.email }}. I check it I promise.</p>
