Hi! I am a software developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I've started working in the industry in 2013.
At that time I was still a student at the [KPI](https://kpi.ua/en), and in 2017 I've got my Master's degree from there.

<p>If you happen to be interested in my professional skills and experience here is my <a href="{% link /assets/docs/resume.pdf %}">one-page resume</a> and here is a <a href="{% link /assets/docs/cv.pdf %}">detailed CV</a>. You can reach me by email: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>. I check it I promise.</p>

Currently I work with ISS Soft Ukraine on development of compilers and tools for code analysis.
Most of the time I program in Common Lisp, though I am familiar with a number of other
programming languages such as Python, Java, and even a bit of Haskell. I also had to work with
monsters like COBOL and PL/SQL. Some of my early experience was in gamedev and localization.

In the university I was really into machine learning and heuristic optimization algorithms (such as genetic algorithms, 
[ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_bee_colony_algorithm), 
[PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization), 
[NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)). 
Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to apply these skills in professional environment (yet).

<p>As a typical programmer I of course have many ideas for projects I never spend time on.
<br/>I've written some Lisp about <a href="https://github.com/theihor/cl-rl">reinforcement learning</a>,
had a not completely embarassing <a href="https://github.com/theihor/cytadels">attempt to implement a desktop game</a> in Python, 
and regularly take part in <a href="https://www.icfpconference.org/contest.html">ICFP contests</a> with my friends.
All of these and some other stuff you may find on my <a href="https://github.com/theihor">github</a>.</p>

Thanks for visiting this page!
