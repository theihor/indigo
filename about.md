Hi! I am a software engineer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I've started to work in software 
development when I still was a student at the [KPI](https://kpi.ua/en), and it's been more than 6 years 
of professional experience now. I've got my Master's degree in 2017.

<p>If you happen to be interested in my professional skills and experience here is my <a href="{% link /assets/docs/resume.pdf %}">one-page resume</a> and here is my <a href="{% link /assets/docs/cv.pdf %}">detailed CV</a>. You can reach me by an email: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>. I check it I promise.</p>

Currently I work with ISS Soft Ukraine on development of compilers and tools for code analysis.
Most of the time I program in Common Lisp, though I am familiar with a number of other
programming languages such as Python, Java, and even a bit of Haskell. I also had to work with
monsters like COBOL and PL/SQL. Some of my early working experience was in gamedev and localization.

In the university I was really into machine learning and heuristic optimization algorithms (such as genetic algorithms, 
[ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_bee_colony_algorithm), 
[PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization), 
[NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)). 
Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to apply these skills in professional environment (yet).

<p>As a typical programmer I of course have many ideas for projects I never spend enough time on :(
<br/>I have some CL <a href="https://github.com/theihor/cl-rl">code about reinforcement learning</a>,
a not completely embarassing <a href="https://github.com/theihor/cytadels">attempt to implement a desktop game</a> in Python, 
code from <a href="https://www.icfpconference.org/contest.html">ICFP contests</a> I regularly take part in with my colleagues, 
and some other stuff that you may find on my <a href="https://github.com/theihor">github</a> if you have nothig better to do.</p>

Thanks for visiting this page! I knew it's not useless!
